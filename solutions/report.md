# Overview of the Population in Europe

In this report, I will give a summary of the population in selected countries throughout Europe.

I analyzed the population of 11 countries from a card game [1]. The smallest country is Luxemburg with 600,000 people. The most populous country is Great Britain with 65,600,000 people. The average is 19.3 million with a standard deviation of 24.6 million. In Figure 1, you can see a box plot of the data.

In summary, the countries in Europe are a broad mix of big and small countries. They are in fact very diverse in population so that it is difficult to find a simple rule that applies to all of them.
