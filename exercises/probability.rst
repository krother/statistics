Session 3: Probability
======================

Consider a population of penguins, with the following absolute
frequencies:

| sex female male species
| Adelie 160 80 Chinstrap 20 80 Gentoo 80 80

Exercise 1: Probabilities
-------------------------

Calculate the probabilities that a randomly selected penguin:

-  is female
-  is an Adelie
-  is a female Adelie
-  is an Adelie or Chinstrap
-  is male or female

Exercise 2: Conditional Probabilities
-------------------------------------

Calculate the probability that

-  a randomly selected Adelie is a female.
-  a randomly selected female is an Adelie

Exercise 3: Probability Tree
----------------------------

Draw a probability tree for the penguins. The first random event in the
tree is the species, the second one is the gender. Calculate all
probabilities and annotate the tree.

Exercise 4: Another Probability Tree
------------------------------------

Now draw a second probability tree but this time the gender should be
the first random event. Calculate all probabilities and annotate the
tree with them.

Exercise 5: Total Probability
-----------------------------

calculate the total probability p(Chinstrap) from the conditional
probabilities p(Chinstrap|male) and p(Chinstrap|female).

Exercise 6: Bayes Theorem
-------------------------

Calculate the conditional probability *p(Chinstrap|male)*. Apply the
Bayes Theorem to also calculate *p(male|Chinstrap)*.

Then apply the Bayes Theorem to calculate the conditional probabilities
in the opposite direction. Do you obtain the same value for
*p(Chinstrap|male)* that you started with?

Exercise 7: Independence
------------------------

When picking random penguins from the above population, are the gender
and the species independent random events?

Exercise 8: Something less amusing
----------------------------------

In Germany, approximately 42000 of 900000 deaths in 2021 were due to
lung carcinoma. 95% of lung carcinoma patients are former smokers. 25%
of the entire population are smoking.

Estimate the probability that a smoker who died in 2022 died of lung
carcinoma.

Assume that the probabilities did not change during one year (in a
long-term projection one would have to take changes in smoking behavior,
e.g.Â e-cigarettes into account).

Exercise 9: Birthdays
---------------------

Calculate the probability that two persons in the classroom have the
same birthday. Check if it actually is the case.
