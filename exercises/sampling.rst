Exercise 1: Ice Cream
---------------------

In the summer, penguins like ice cream.
Every penguin has their own individual taste. 
Let's consider three penguins:

* **Ada** likes to have one scoop of each type available. She refuses to eat ice cream with fewer scoops. The order of the scoops matters, so `mango-vanilla` is not the same as `vanilla-mango`.
* **Bashir** likes to have 2, 3 or 4 scoops. The order does not matter, but every type of ice cream must occur only once.
* **Choi** has a taste very similar to Bashir, but a type of ice cream may occur multiple times.
* **Dob** has a taste very similar to Choi, but the order of the scoops matters.

Create a table showing how many different ice cream cones one could build for each penguin.
Consider the following cases:

* 2 types of ice cream and 2 scoops
* 3 types of ice cream and 2 scoops
* 3 types of ice cream and 3 scoops
* 4 types of ice cream and 2 scoops
* 4 types of ice cream and 3 scoops
  

Exercise 2: Ice Cream Deluxe
----------------------------

The penguins have found an ice cream shop that offers 32 different types of ice cream.
Bashir seizes the opportunity and orders an ice cream with 7 scoops.
How many friends should he invite to try all possible combinations?

Exercise 3: Ice Cream Factory
-----------------------------

The penguins have found the ice cream factory.
The factory continuously produces ice cream scoops and puts them on a conveyor belt.

One in ten scoops is a mango ice cream scoop.
Choi grabs 10 scoops at random.
What is the probability that they have exactly 3 mango scoops?


Exercise 4: Packaging
---------------------

The scoops are packaged into boxes of 100 scoops.
What is the probability that a box will contain exactly 15 mango scoops?

**Optional:** What is the probability that a box contains 5 scoops *or less*?
