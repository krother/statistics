Session 5: Using Distributions
==============================

Exercise 1: Maintenance
-----------------------

Like any engineering product, the ice cream machines in the factory have to be maintained.
Of the 10 machine, 2.2 stop working every month, and are brought back after a short break.

What is the probability that a single machine will produce ice cream for an entire year without being maintained?

Exercise 2: Body Mass
---------------------

After having a lot of ice cream, the penguins are slowly putting on weight for the coming winter.
The **Adelie** penguins have an average body mass of 3700 g and a standard deviation of 460 g.
Let's assume their weights are normally distributed.

Answer the following questions:

* Ada weighs exactly 3000g. Is she among the slimmest 10%?
* Bashir is weighing 3850g. How many penguins are between 3700 and 4000g
* Choi weighs 4600g. What is the chance that a single penguin is heavier?

**Optional:** Calculate the z-score for all three penguins.


Exercise 3: Ice Floe
--------------------

Now the penguins have to be a bit careful when they step on an ice floe.
A typical ice floe carries 8000g before capsizing.

Two penguins jump on an ice floe. What is the probability that they take a bath?


Exercise 8: Meet the Chinstraps
-------------------------------

The Chinstraps have been busy eating fish in the meantime.
Their weight has a mean of 3733 g and a standard deviation of 380 g.

Pairs of one Adelie and Chinstrap penguin compare their weight.
What is the probability that the Adelie penguin is heavier?


Exercise 9: Big Floe
--------------------

The penguins found a bigger ice floe that carries up to 40kg.
Is it safe enough to carry 10 penguins?
