# Lesson Plan for Session 1: Variables, Measures of Centrality and Dispersion

## Concepts:

- absolute frequency
- relative frequency
- histogram
- group by category
- aggregation function
- crosstable / pivot

## Lesson plan

- recap: DB questions
- recap: metrics on the pin wall

### Part 1: plots

- primer: names of penguins
- find two volunteers
- plot histogram from beak sizes
- annotate: 68.3% 1sd, 95.6% 2sd, 99.7% 3sd
- good and bad plots in groups
- write down best practices

### Part 2: Pivots

- group by one category
- create bar plot
- create box plot
- group by two categories -> crosstable
- define crosstab
- create bar plot
- create heatmap

### Part 3: Normalization

- create crosstab with counts
- normalize by species
- normalize by gender
- define: relative frequency
- normalize by min/max
- normalize by average/sd -> z-score

### Wrap-up

- exam requirements
- transfer: write penguin report
