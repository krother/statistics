# Distributions

## Goal

**Students explain a distribution function.**

----

## Key Concepts

* probability density function
* cumulative probability density function
* Law of Large Numbers
* Central Limit Theorem
* distributions:
  * uniform distribution
  * triangular
  * binomial distribution
  * Poisson distribution
  * Normal Distribution
  * Standard Normal distribution
  * skewed Normal Distribution


## Recap: Check and Cross

* discrete variable
* normal distribution
* histogram
* standard deviation
* Bayes Theorem
* prior
* conditional probability
* multiplication rule
* median
* random variable

---

### Exercise

Creating random samples from all the distributions using numpy.
Plot histograms of each.
Vary N, plot histogram of each.

-> find law of large numbers and central limit theorem
